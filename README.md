# LipNet-Redux

## Overview
In this project, I aim to recreate the original LipNet model and add to it modern Computer Vision, thereby creating a tool which can read mouths in ongoing conversation. I am using Tensorflow and Python to acheive this. 

Note: This is an ongoing project, the end goal is to have a Web App which allows for live lip reading!

## Project Structure
- `LipNet Redux.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all my advances.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
